RUNBOOK (frontend)
- Purpose: Allow user to input daily KPI values and compute a simple benchmark range and anomaly severity as per agreed thresholds.
- How to deploy: copy files to repo root or to 'frontend/' and set GitHub Pages to serve from that folder.
- Customization points:
  * app.js: thresholds and bands (function determineAnomaly)
  * styles.css: colors and spacing (CI)
  * index.html: text content (Thai/EN)
- Notes: This is a lite version. Keep backend code separate in archive branch.
